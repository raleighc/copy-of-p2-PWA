                                Thank you. I believe they have been set free somehow. I don't know why I'm still here,
                                but it may
                                have something to do with my insistence that this land is mine and only mine. In my
                                younger days on
                                the homestead,
                                we had to fight each other for resources, and maybe I wasn't so kind to my neighbors.
                                Perhaps that's
                                why I'm stuck. I would appreciate any help. I just want to leave this house.
